<How to use classes and objects>

This section describes object-oriented programming, which is class-based in MachiKania. MachiKania allows class-based object-oriented programming with the following features

　(1) Objects have fields (public or private) and methods (public only).
　(2) Classes are described in separate files, with one class per file.
　(3) Multiple classes can be used. Also, another class can be used within a class.
　(4) Class inheritance is not implemented.
　(5) Field names and method names can be alphanumeric characters of more than 2.

By writing a class as a separate file and specifying this file as a class, it is possible to create a program consisting of multiple files. Connections between classes are made only via fields and methods. Therefore, even if a variable or label with the same name exists in multiple files, each file is controlled individually, so there is no name conflict.

<How to Write a Class>

To create a class, prepare a text file with the name "classname.BAS". The class name must be between 2 and 8 alphanumeric characters long. In the class file, the FIELD, STATIC, and/or METHOD instruction(s) is/are required.

FIELD [PUBLIC] x[,y[,z[, ... ]]]
	Declares a public field in the class file. PUBLIC" can be omitted. x, y, z, etc. are field names of alphanumeric characters. If the field is used as a string type, "$" must be added after the field name.
FIELD PRIVATE x[,y[,z[, ... ]]]
	Declares a private field in the class file. x, y, z, etc. are field names of alphanumeric characters. If the field is used as a string type, "$" should be added after the field name, and "()" should be added when the field is used as an array.
STATIC [PUBLIC] x[,y[,z[, ... ]]]
	Declares a public static variable in the class file." PUBLIC" may be omitted.
STATIC PRIVATE x[,y[,z[, ... ]]]
	Declares a private static variable in the class file. This is the same as "USEVAR".
METHOD x
	Declares a method in the class file. x is the name of the method with alphanumeric characters.

To access field values (both public and private) in a class file, access (read and write) directly to the variable with the long name specified FIELD. Notations such as "THIS" are not required.

Object fields can be assigned not only integer values and real numbers, but also strings and arrays. When strings, arrays, etc. are assigned, memory area is allocated separately from the object itself. Therefore, when rewriting these fields, use the DELETE statement to destroy the memory area of the field before rewriting.

If you want to access a static variable that is not a field of an object, use the STATIC or USEVAR instruction. A variable with a long name used here does not affect the value of a variable with the same name in other files. However, reading or changing variables A-Z will affect the values used in other files.

All methods declared with the METHOD instruction are public. Use the LABEL and GOSUB instructions/functions for private subroutine calls. Arguments for method calls can be retrieved with the ARGS() function. If a pointer to its own object is needed in the method, it can be retrieved with ARGS(-2).

To specify a constructor, use "METHOD INIT". If the INIT method is specified in this way, it will be called when the object is created; it is also possible to give arguments to the INIT method (arguments are not required if not needed).

Example (saved under the name CLASS1.BAS)
　FIELD PUBLIC TEST1,TEST2
　FIELD PRIVATE TEST3
　STATIC PUBLIC TEST7
　METHOD INIT
　　IF ARGS(0)=2 THEN
　　　TEST1=ARGS(1)
　　　TEST2=ARGS(2)
　　ENDIF
　RETURN
　METHOD TEST4
　　TEST1=ARGS(1)
　　TEST2=ARGS(2)
　RETURN
　METHOD TEST5
　　TEST3=TEST1+TEST2+TEST7
　RETURN METHOD TEST6
　METHOD TEST6
　RETURN TEST3
　METHOD TEST8
　RETURN TEST7

<How to create an object>

To create an object, first specify the class to be used with the USECLASS instruction, and then use the NEW function.

USECLASS x[,y[,z[, ... ]]]
	Declares the use of the class. x,y,z, etc. are class names up to 8 alphanumeric characters.
NEW(x[,y[,z[, ... ]]])
	Creates a class object and returns a pointer to the object. x specifies the class name. y, z, etc. are arguments used when there is a constructor.

Example 1
　USECLASS CLASS1
　A=NEW(CLASS1)

Example 2 (when arguments are specified for the constructor): USECLASS CLASS1
　USECLASS CLASS1
　A=NEW(CLASS1,123,456)

<How to destroy an object>

Created objects can also be destroyed using the DELETE instruction. Note that, since the destructor is not implemented, if necessary, create a method for it and call it just before destroying the object.

If the fields of the object are strings or arrays, these areas will not be destroyed simply by DELETE of the object. In this case, first destroy these fields in the method (a DELETE instruction can be used) and then destroy the object.

Example
　USECLASS CLASS1
　A=NEW(CLASS1)
　DELETE A

<How to Access Fields>

To access a public field, enter the variable containing the object followed by "." that is followed by the name of the field. If the field is a character string, add a "$" after it, and if the field is a real number, add a "#" after it.

Example
　USECLASS CLASS1
　A=NEW(CLASS1)
　A.TEST1=123
　PRINT A.TEST2

<How to access methods>

To access a public method, enter a variable containing an object followed by ".", by the name of the method, and by "( )". If the method returns a string as the return value, append "$" to the method name ("#" for real numbers). Methods are treated like functions, but they can also be called with the CALL instruction if the return value is not used. Note that when calling a method in the same class, it should be called with the GOSUB instruction, not a static method call.

CALL x
	Calls the method of the object specified by x.

Example description (579 is displayed)
　USECLASS CLASS1
　A=NEW(CLASS1)
　CALL A.TEST4(123,456)
　CALL A.TEST5()
　PRINT A.TEST6()

<Use of Static Variables and Static Methods>

Variables specified with "STATIC PUBLIC" in a class can be referenced or modified externally. In this case, the class name must be followed by "::" and the name of the variable.

Each method can also be used as a static method. In this case, enter the class name followed by "::" and the name of the method, followed by "( )".

Example (123 is displayed):
　USECLASS CLASS1
　CLASS1::TEST6=123
　PRINT CLASS1::TEST7()

<To assign a string or array to a field of an object>

You can also assign a string or an array to a field of an object. In this case, use the DELETE instruction to destroy the corresponding string or array when destroying the object.

Example Description (MAIN.BAS):
　USECLASS CLASS1
　O=NEW(CLASS1)
　O.DSTRCT()
　DELETE O
Example description (CLASS1.BAS):
　FIELD DAT,STR
　METHOD INIT
　DIM DAT(100)
　STR="TEST"
　RETURN
　METHOD DSTRCT
　DELETE DAT
　DELETE STR
　RETURN

<About the library>

Class files are read if there is a "classname.BAS" file in the current directory. If the file is not in the current directory, it will be read from the "\LIB\class name\class name.BAS" file, if available. Therefore, if you place a group of classes in the "\LIB" directory, you can use them as a library that can be used at any time.

In KM-1507 and later BASIC compilers, if you want to load different BAS files as classes for Raspberry Pi Pico (or boards with RP2040) and Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (or boards with RP2350), or MachiKania type P and Type PU, it is possible to load separate BAS files depending on the situation by creating sub-directories such as “PICO2”, “TYPEPU”, “TYPEPU/PICO2” in the directory where classes are placed and placing BAS files there. For example, if the following four BAS files are prepared, the required BAS file can be loaded depending on the situation.

　\LIB\classname\TYPEPU\PICO2\classname.BAS
　\LIB\classname\PICO2\classname.BAS
　\LIB\classname\TYPEPU\classname.BAS
　\LIB\classname\classname.BAS

The following example does not distinguish between Type P and Type PU, but wants to use them separately for Pico and Pico 2.

　\LIB\classname\PICO2\classname.BAS
　\LIB\classname\classname.BAS

If a single BAS file is sufficient without such distinction, the arrangement is as follows

　\LIB\classname\classname.BAS
